# LittleSun-Project ðŸŒ»

# Team: Milana, Charlotte & Faheer 

# For the Little Sun project in Zambia, we need to build a web based application that would allow the organization to organize work in their centers. We will come up with a solution that allows managers to create work schedules and plan shifts for workers in a user friendly way.

# Our goal is to make it possible for a local center to operate with our tool. Local workers should be able to know when they need to work on what tasks while being able to plan their work shifts in their lives.
